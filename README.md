# Virtual Labs
Online platform for learning CS concepts through interactive simulations.

Each Experiment have 4 tabs--
1. Theory Page : It has theory content all about experiment.
2. Simulation  : It has simulation related to experiment using p5.js
3. Analysis    : It has nice analysis of experiment using chart.js or mcqs.
4. Code Arena  : It has coding question, input and output test case and coding
                 environment in which code can be written and run using Piston API.

There are 7 experiments 

-> Data Structure and Algorithms
1. Insertion Sort
2. Path Finding Algorithm

-> Object Oriented Programming
3. Classes and Objects
4. Construtor and Destructor
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

-> Operating System
7. Process Scheduling Algorithms
