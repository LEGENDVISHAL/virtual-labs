# **Virtual Labs** ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
### An online platform containing simulations for different CS concept. Learn by visualizations at no cost.
##### Contains `Theory` , `Simulation` , `Analysis` , `Code Arena` tabs for each topic covered, to get in-depth understanding and hands on practise.

### Need of the project :
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Labs is an initiative to enhance the online learning experience of CS students especially, by providing interactive **simulations** and **visualizations**. There are many virtual labs available which are created by IIT and NITs, but for most of their labs `Adobe Flash Player` is used to run the simulations which is deprecated and not compatible with the web now-a-days.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking all this into consideration, we decided to make simulations for the core CS topics like **Data Structures & Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming and Operating System.** `p5.js` is an interactive and modern javascript graphics library used for games and animations. p5 was used for making the simulations in this project.

### Topics Covered :
| Subject           | Topic                                                                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DS & Algorithms   | Insertion Sort, Path Finding Algorithms                                  |
| OOPS              | Classes & Objects, Constructors & Destructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism |
| Operating Systems | Process Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin)                        |

### Tools Used
Backend
- [Flask]

Frontend
- [p5.js] graphics library for animations.
- [Bootstrap 4]
- [Jinja] templating
- [CodeMirror] API (for the awesome code editor.)
